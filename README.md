# n8n-automation-tests
n8n projects - Json files mostly
This project houses all the n8n automation json files. The files can be loaded into your n8n instance and update/add credential keys.

n8n setup:
You will need to deploy nodejs and if you want to manage multiple versions of nodejs you will also need nvm 
1. node js: https://nodejs.org/en
2. nvm : https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows
3. once both are installed:
    - use this command on your terminal: npm install n8n -g
4. once this deploy is complete
    - in a new terminal.. enter this command: n8n
    - this will start n8n and you will see a link to access it.
